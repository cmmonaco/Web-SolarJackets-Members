# Solar Jackets Members Area Website

Developed in 2010, this site was designed as an intranet equipped with several tools to assist with project management for the solar racing team at Georgia Tech. The system allowed for announcements, event registration management, and a resource repository. The site is powered entirely by PHP and MySQL. The site is not longer live.
